"""Leader side of the Mooncake store KV cache connector.

Runs on every ADP owner, or only rank 0 for TP. It decides what to load and
what to save; the local worker owns the store connection. Two pieces of
bookkeeping make that possible, and both exist because
`KVCacheManagerV2` reports `RequestData.block_hashes` empty:

* a hash chain per request, so a block has a content identity at all;
* the page slot index per block ordinal, accumulated across iterations. The
  manager reports only *newly allocated* indices each step, but a block is
  allocated before it is full and is only savable once it is full, so the index
  has to be remembered from the step that reported it.
